# glucose2

A Python, Sqlite, and Matplotlib project to chart my daily blood glucose levels. I am using the caddy webserver to front-end the web site with an https server that uses opensource security certificates.  I am also using this project to delve into the Go programming language which i feel is about to spring onto the web app development scene.

This is the 2nd major version of the software, which involves a significant refactoring. This new version supports tracking the average daily blood glucose reading over a long time period, e.g. years, not just months. It can be viewed at https://wtrenker.com .

This long term observation provides a means to watch the blood glucose trend as alternative medications are tried (e.g. Jardiance).
