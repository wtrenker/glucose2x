# glucose2

A Python, Sqlite, and Matplotlib project to chart my daily blood glucose levels. This is the 2nd major version of the glucose software, which involves a significant refactoring. This new version supports tracking the average daily blood glucose reading over a long time period, ultimately years, not just months. Its live beginnings can be viewed at https://wtrenker.com.

A major feature is that the chart is generated in real-time so when I update the database daily I don't have to do anything to replot the chart. This long term observation provides a means to watch the blood glucose trend as alternative medications are tried. A very realistic example, documented on the live chart, is the amazing improvement that Jardiance has made. I share this chart with my healthcare professionals who find it very helpful.

I am using the opensource Caddy webserver to front-end the web site. Caddy is an https server that uses opensource security certificates.  It is a production-grade server written in the Go programming language. I am also using this project to delve into the Go language which I feel is about to spring onto the web app development scene. As a Computer Scientist, working over the years in various computer languages, I think that the Go language brings together many of the advantageous features desired by the programming specialists in my profession.
